# GroCH - MOA Implementation
This repository contains the implementation of GroCH, iGNGSVM and RCARF, and scripts to run parameter-tuning for the MOA implementation GroCH in an HPC cluster using SLURM.

It also contains the ADDM drift detector, which consists of two embedded ADWIN confidence intervals under the same detector. One to signal warnings and another for concept drifts.

Older versions of GroCH as referred as 'NA'/'NA.java' in the scripts.
